# rubiks_cube_solver
An Android app that is capable of solving a Rubik's cube and visualizing a step-by-step guide (with a 3D model of the cube). The app can also teach common ways of solving Rubik's cubes (perhaps not only 3 by 3) with visual examples. Lastly, the app could determine a cube's full layout with a photo of it and figure out the solution (or that one does not exist).
